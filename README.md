# Tea Leaf Disease Detection



This project detects diseases on tea leaves using a YOLO-based object detection model. It identifies various leaf diseases from images and provides visual results.



## Features



* Detect multiple tea leaf diseases in images.

* Use YOLOv8 for object detection.

* Easy to train on custom datasets.



## Installation



Clone the repository:



```bash

git clone https://github.com/AmirSalajegheh/tea\_leaf\_diseases.git

cd tea\_leaf\_diseases

```



Install required Python packages:



```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```



## Usage



After installing the requirements, you can run the detection and training scripts provided in the repository. Place your input images in the `Data` folder and the trained model `best.pt` is also stored there.
